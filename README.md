# Rust Learning Documentation

This Rust learning repository is part of the Life Long Learning Documentation, where the contents would be the same (maybe different content structures), but as in a public repo instead of a private one. 

## Rust Errors

 - In WSL 2.x, when `rustc` got "Permission denied (os error 13)" error. Solved by installing: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
