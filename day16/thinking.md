# Thinking

To calculate pi with Monte Carlo method, I will need to generate a circle and estimate the area of the circle by random sampling the number of points falling within the circle and referencing to a known area shape, e.g. a square with `area=1.0`. 


# Results

Python code is not as effective as rust code:
 - lower accuracy
 - higher variability
 - slower

Rust code result is more stable, faster and higher accuracy.
